      <description>Timekeepers Motorcycle Club (TMC) was founded by Don Matheson in the fall of 1983 because he wanted the ability to give formal input to Northern Californiaâ€™s District 36 racing organization regarding enduro and cross country race rules. To be able to do this required the formation of a D36 and AMA chartered Club.The process involved filling out an application with both AMA and D36. The Club (TMC) had to have at least 12 members and they all had to belong to the AMA organization.</description>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><p>Timekeepers Motorcycle Club (TMC) was founded by Don Matheson in the fall of 1983 because he wanted the ability to give formal input to Northern California’s District 36 racing organization regarding enduro and cross country race rules. To be able to do this required the formation of a D36 and AMA chartered Club.The process involved filling out an application with both AMA and D36. The Club (TMC) had to have at least 12 members and they all had to belong to the AMA organization. Once chartered and recognized by the local and national governing bodies, TMC (as a Club) was entitled to two (2) votes at District 36 meetings regarding rule book changes, competition committee business and any other business requiring a simple majority vote for inclusion.
After acquiring the necessary paperwork, Don Matheson invited twelve of his riding buddies to his house in Los Gatos and began to sell the idea of forming a new Club to the Silicon Valley. At that historic meeting Don explained the advantages of forming a Club. The sales pitch worked and the remainder of the meeting time was used to elect officers, work on a mission statement and come up with a Club “name”. Over the next few months this group worked together to comply with the requirements of AMA and D36 to become a nationally recognized Club. In January of 1984 AMA and D36 officially chartered our TIMEKEEPERS M/C.</p>
<p>TMC accomplished quite a bit during it’s first year of existance. We brought about a rule book change that added a “Veteran” ( 30-39 years old) class to District 36, and hosted our first event; the Wild Boar Enduro at Clear Creek Management Area near Coalinga, California with the start/finish on Salinas Ramblers Property. The 1984 Wild Boar enduro consisted of over 120 miles of trails laid out by Randy Carles and Don Matheson. Approximately 400 riders turned up onthe first weekend of December to brave the course and weather. Wild Boar 1 included many signs made up by John Staton, which by wording, described the terrain or obstacle (like “Clevelands Crevice”, “Lips Ledge”, “Bulldog Hill”, and others) the rider was about to encounter. Nobody got lost and the riders finished tired but satisfied.</p>
<p>Wild Boar 2 was hosted again at Clear Creek in 1985, but this time the start was moved to the town of New Idira. Due to snowy weather many of the C-riders houred out before the half way point. Those who did make it over Idria Peak were treated to miles of great trails with horsepower robbing traction. The event drew about 300 riders and was financially successful for a second time.</p>
<p>Wild Boar 3 quickly turned in to the Wild Boar National Enduro in 1986 because the Salinas Ramblers were forced to cancel the Quicksilver in February.TMC Club members went all out (especially Randy Carles) to put together 125 miles of the most challenging terrain that we could find at the Creek. Unfortunately the premier traction due to rain dried out the week before our event and turned things into a dust bowl. Of the approximate 275 participants, only 11 A-riders finished the course without houring out. Trophies were given to the riders on a lowest score-most checks finished basis. Event winner, Jeff Irwin, stated in Cycle News “that it was the most technical event that he had ever ridden and that the last 15 miles required total concentration”.</p>
<p>In 1987 most of the Club members had burned themselves out by working so hard on the previous events we did not host an enduro that year. Instead the Club began to lay plans to give our first try at a Hare Scrambles and use Clear Creek for event. Prime Time Hare Scrambles was hosted in early 1988 with the start of the race at the bottom of a hill near Staging Area 1. The A and B riders rode first and navigated approximately 30 miles of trail before coming back trough the start/finish area. The race was 2 hours long. The C-riders rode the second race which lasted 1.5 hours. We drew only 88 riders because we goofed and had the race on Superbowl Sunday. Nobody got hurt and the Club was amazed at how much less work a Hare Scrambles was than an Enduro.</p>
<p>Prime Time II (1989) was (we almost killed the guy that got us the same date as Superbowl Sunday again) held at the Creek, but this time the start was moved to near Staging Area 3. We got about the same number of riders (what a surprise!) as the previous year. This year we ran another 30 mile loop comprised of completely different trails from the previous year. Weather and traction was good and participant’s went home happy.</p>
<p>Prime Time III (1990) was held in March (we finally came up with a date that was good from a weather perspective) and riders were greeted Sunday morning with about a half inch of snow! We delayed the start until 10 AM and put on probably the best Hare Scrambles in Clear Creek history. Everyone had a great time during the first race. The second race started uneventfully, but during the last ½ hour the weather turned cold, foggy and nasty. Phil Douglas and the rest of the finish line check crew could hear, but not see, incoming riders until they were almost in the check. We had about 175 riders and made a few bucks. After the race there was still plenty of action as many people slid around (and in one case; off) the road heading home.</p>
<p>For 1991 Lips decided that we should do something different and talked the club into putting on the Jade Mill Qualifier. In the early 90’s a lot of folks were interested in the qualifier concept, with the Los Altos Dirt Bikers and High Sierra MC hosting events of their own. Our first try was centered around the Jade Mill mine site. We worked with the resident caretaker and were able to actually use the main house and one of the out buildings for sign up and club usage. We laid out a great course and the folks that rode it were really pleased at the trail selections and the fantastic traction due to plenty of rain preceeding our event. The final moto was run at the Jade Mill site with riders circumventing the house and using surrounding hillsides. Entrants were provided with participation stickers,and olympic styled cast gold, silver and bronze medals for all finishers. T-shirts designed by John Staton were sold on site and were a big hit with everyone.</p>
<p>In 1992 we went back to Clear Creek again for another second Jade Mill Qualifier. The 92 event was more profitable because Jiffy Dave decided we should re-issue the left over medals (we bought 500) from the previous year. The course was completely different mainly due to the work of Terry Pederson and Dave Raymond laying out plently of new stuff east of the Brushy Trail. The final moto was similar to 91 except it did not circumvent the house, but ran adjacent to it. Rider turn out was good and we made some bucks.
1993 was to be the last qualifier until 1997. By now most of the old timers were completely burned out. Dale Greenhalgh coordinated the majority of the trail efforts, with Rick Cameron laying out the easiest (and later due to rain, the most popular) course of all with short special tests. I was especially pleased when John Haaker stopped in the middle of a special test section to tell me how much he liked the course. Art Vasconcellas was the event coordinator and did an incredible job organizing the event. Two riders got lost near the KCAC mine. TMC personnel worked closely with BLM and the hiway patrol to look for the unfortunates. Dale Greenhalgh found one rider off-course and brought him back in. A second rider was found walking the course and rescued by TMC personnel. Using basic first aid and common sense the riders were treated for hypothermia inside Art’s motorhome and were released in good shape to go home.</p>
<p>Charlie Stanley worked with the Hollister Hills Off Road Association in 1994 and TMC involvement included Club members working a family enduro as a joint project.</p>
<p>In 1995 Art Vasconcellas influenced TMC into putting on a second family enduro at Hollister Hills. The Wild Boar Family Enduro was held on a blend of the upper and lower ranches. Event participation was somewhat hampered by a change of date because of early rains, but the folks that turned out had a good time. Same day trophies were awarded.</p>
<p>In 1996, the club voted to put on a Hare Scrambles at Clear Creek with the trails to be used the following year, 1997, in a Qualifier that the club also committed to hosting. Kent and Dean Jenkins volunteered to coordinate the 96 Hare Scrambles, working with Don Matheson to incorporate the course into the 1997 Qualifier that Don was to head up. The Hare Scrambles ended up a fantastic success, with riders treated to a great course laid out by Bill Benson and concessions by Jiffy Dave Dellavecchia, preliminary scores within 15 minutes of the finish, but with the event held at Hollister Hills.</p>
<p>1997 – Jade Mill Qualifier4 (at Clear Creek). Lips pretty much single handedly pushed this race through, but took the time to train a few new members concerning the art of trail selection, pruning and marking. The race began withthe entrants traveling 7 miles from Oak Flat Campground to Staging Area 2. After gassing up, they began one of two identical loops around a course of approximately 43 miles. At the end of the second loop the riders traveled several miles (on new trails) to the Jade Mill mine site where they competed in the final moto which started and finished at the edge of the campground. Recycled medals (again) were mailed to those who won Gold, Silver or Bronze medals.</p>
